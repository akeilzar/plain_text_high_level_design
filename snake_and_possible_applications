The classic video game snake has variable 
that can be adapted for other uses.

This came to mind looking at variable in 
etherium etc but many other apps maybe even
cooking a curry for example or a vowel and 
consonant %modulus loop generator for 
trivial words for creative input 
to other functions.

Snake has x, y value as x y

x

y

Snake has length of the Snake as l

l

Snake has x y of food as xf yf

xf

yf

Snake has a score as s

s

Snke has a time as t

t

Table:

0. x
1. y
2. l
3. xf
4. yf
5. s
6. t

Now let us add more variables using an 
adapted version of those present.

7. ceil(x % 2.71)
8. ceil(y % 2.71)
9. ceil(l % 2.71)
A. ceil(xf % 2.71)
B. ceil(yf % 2.71)
C. ceil(s % 2.71)
D. ceil(t % 2.71)

This table can extended with 
arbitrary operations and rempped
to any dataset for any creative purpose.

This makes a game of snake sort of like a special
dice roll. Common sense, but I don't mind the 
reminder. Thanks :D
